//! Ordered delivery of finalized blocks.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The core of the module is the [actor::Actor]. It marshals the finalized blocks into order by:
//!
//! - Receiving uncertified blocks from a broadcast mechanism
//! - Receiving notarizations and finalizations from consensus
//! - Reconstructing a total order of finalized blocks
//! - Providing a backfill mechanism for missing blocks
//!
//! The actor interacts with four main components:
//! - [crate::Reporter]: Receives ordered, finalized blocks at-least-once
//! - [crate::simplex]: Provides consensus messages
//! - Application: Provides verified blocks
//! - [commonware_broadcast::buffered]: Provides uncertified blocks received from the network
//! - [commonware_resolver::Resolver]: Provides a backfill mechanism for missing blocks
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! ## Delivery
//!
//! The actor will deliver a block to the reporter at-least-once. The reporter should be prepared to
//! handle duplicate deliveries. However the blocks will be in order.
//!
//! ## Finalization
//!
//! The actor uses a view-based model to track the state of the chain. Each view corresponds
//! to a potential block in the chain. The actor will only finalize a block (and its ancestors)
//! if it has a corresponding finalization from consensus.
//!
//! _It is possible that there may exist multiple finalizations for the same block in different views. Marshal
//! only concerns itself with verifying a valid finalization exists for a block, not that a specific finalization
//! exists. This means different Marshals may have different finalizations for the same block persisted to disk._
//!
//! ## Backfill
//!
//! The actor provides a backfill mechanism for missing blocks. If the actor notices a gap in its
//! knowledge of finalized blocks, it will request the missing blocks from its peers. This ensures
//! that the actor can catch up to the rest of the network if it falls behind.
//!
//! ## Storage
//!
//! The actor uses a combination of internal and external ([commonware_storage::archive]) storage
//! to store blocks and finalizations. Internal storage is used to store data that is only needed for a short
//! period of time, such as unverified blocks or notarizations. External storage is used to
//! store data that needs to be persisted indefinitely, such as finalized blocks.
//!
//! Marshal will store all blocks after a configurable starting height (or, floor) onward.
//! This allows for state sync from a specific height rather than from genesis. When
//! updating the starting height, marshal will attempt to prune blocks in external storage
//! that are no longer needed.
//!
//! _Setting a configurable starting height will prevent others from backfilling blocks below said height. This
//! feature is only recommended for applications that support state sync (i.e., those that don't require full
//! block history to participate in consensus)._
//!
//! ## Limitations and Future Work
//!
//! - Only works with [crate::simplex] rather than general consensus.
//! - Assumes at-most one notarization per view, incompatible with some consensus protocols.
//! - Uses [`broadcast::buffered`](`commonware_broadcast::buffered`) for broadcasting and receiving
//!   uncertified blocks from the network.
