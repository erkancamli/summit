# Deposits and Withdrawals

## Deposits
- Deposits follow the EIP-6110, although the contract is slightly modified to support an additional validator key.
- Potential validators have to deposit at least **MINIMUM_STAKE** to join the network.
- If a potential validator makes an initial deposit with *amount* < **MINIMUM_STAKE**, then the validator account is still created, but it won't be set to active.
- Top-up deposits are allowed.
- Once a processed deposit brings an inactive validator's balance to at least **MINIMUM_STAKE**, activation is scheduled **VALIDATOR_NUM_WARM_UP_EPOCHS** later, provided fewer than **MAX_VALIDATOR_COUNT** validators are active or joining. Deposit processing occurs near epoch end and is subject to **MAX_DEPOSITS_PER_EPOCH**, so activation may be delayed from submission.
- If **MAX_VALIDATOR_COUNT** is already occupied by active and joining validators, a valid deposit is still credited but the validator remains inactive and no activation is scheduled.
- Deposit requests with invalid signatures will be refunded as a withdrawal. K% of the deposited amount (**INVALID_DEPOSIT_TAX**, default 5%) is sent to the treasury address (the zero address by default, which effectively burns it). This prevents invalid deposits from becoming a DDOS vector.
- if the deposit's keys are malformed, it is refunded with the same K% tax applied to invalid signatures.
- If the deposit's consensus (BLS) key does not match the key already on the account (or is already used by another validator), the deposit is refunded with the same K% tax applied to invalid signatures.
- If a deposit lands for an account that no longer exists, then a new account is created.

## Withdrawals
- Withdrawals follow the EIP-7002 spec.
- A withdrawal is accepted only when its source address matches the validator's withdrawal credentials and the validator has not reached **MAX_PENDING_WITHDRAWALS_PER_VALIDATOR**.
- Partial withdrawals are allowed. Active validators retain at least **MINIMUM_STAKE**. Inactive validators have no minimum balance floor, and a withdrawal from a joining validator first cancels its activation.
- For an active validator, amount=0 requests a full exit. The request is rejected if the exit would leave fewer than **MINIMUM_VALIDATOR_COUNT** active validators.
- An accepted full exit processed in epoch E removes the validator at the end of E and schedules its payout for epoch **E + VALIDATOR_WITHDRAWAL_NUM_EPOCHS**. **MAX_WITHDRAWALS_PER_EPOCH** may delay the payout.
- Multiple partial withdrawals may be pending, up to **MAX_PENDING_WITHDRAWALS_PER_VALIDATOR**. At payout, each partial withdrawal is capped again using the current balance and prospective **MINIMUM_STAKE**.
- **MAX_WITHDRAWALS_PER_EPOCH** is a total payout cap. Validator withdrawals take priority over deposit refunds, and overflow remains queued for a later epoch.
- An invalid deposit may create separate refund and treasury withdrawals. Each withdrawal consumes one slot under the payout cap.
- Requests included in the last block of epoch E remain buffered until the penultimate block of E+1. An accepted exit then occurs at the end of E+1, with payout scheduled for epoch **E + 1 + VALIDATOR_WITHDRAWAL_NUM_EPOCHS**, subject to the withdrawal cap.

## Validator Count Limits
- **MAX_VALIDATOR_COUNT** defaults to 256 and limits admission of **Active + Joining** validators, not the total number of stored accounts. Joining validators reserve a slot throughout warm-up.
- At epoch processing, the final proposed **MINIMUM_VALIDATOR_COUNT** and **MAX_VALIDATOR_COUNT** are evaluated together, using the last valid request for each. If minimum exceeds maximum, all updates to those two parameters in the pending batch are discarded before withdrawal or deposit decisions; the existing pair remains in effect. Unrelated parameter updates are retained. Valid paired changes are independent of request ordering.
- Lowering the maximum does not evict active validators or cancel previously reserved activations. Membership may exceed the new maximum until validators leave; further admissions are blocked in the meantime.
- Raising the maximum does not automatically activate funded inactive accounts. Another valid deposit must trigger admission, and any pending withdrawal still prevents reactivation.
- Withdrawals are processed before queued deposits are credited. An accepted active full exit or joining-validator cancellation frees an admission slot for that batch; a rejected withdrawal or active partial withdrawal does not. Deposits compete for available slots in deposit-queue order.
- A withdrawal for an account first created by a deposit in that same batch is dropped because the account does not yet exist. The deposit is still credited; a later authorized withdrawal can reclaim it. Cap-blocked inactive accounts can withdraw without the active-validator minimum-balance floor.
- Stored state must have minimum no greater than maximum. However, membership can legitimately exceed the stored maximum after a reduction or while a queued increase is already being used for admission. Checkpoint recovery and network sizing must account for those cases.

## Validator Balance
- All active validators must have a balance of at least **MINIMUM_STAKE**.
- There is no upper limit on validator balance, however, there is no advantage (such as higher chance of becoming a leader) in having a balance that exceeds **MINIMUM_STAKE**.
- The **MINIMUM_STAKE** may be changed via a protocol parameter execution request.
- If **MINIMUM_STAKE** is increased during epoch E, then on the last block of epoch E, the validators with *balance* < **MINIMUM_STAKE** will be removed from the committee. The balance remains in their account and can be withdrawn at any time.
- Exception: if applying the updated **MINIMUM_STAKE** would leave fewer than **MINIMUM_VALIDATOR_COUNT** validators in the committee, then the change is rejected. The previous **MINIMUM_STAKE** remains in effect and no validators are removed.
- Joining validators with *balance* < **MINIMUM_STAKE** will have their activation canceled.
- The epoch's deposits are processed before the updated **MINIMUM_STAKE** is enforced, so a validator's balance already includes any same-epoch deposit when enforcement runs. If a top-up in the same epoch restores a validator to at least **MINIMUM_STAKE**, it stays in the committee.
- A validator still below **MINIMUM_STAKE** after its deposits are applied is removed from the committee and set to inactive. Its balance remains in the account and can be withdrawn at any time.
